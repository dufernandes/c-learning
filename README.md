# c-learning

I haven't worked with C for more than a decade. It is a language I always would liked have developed professionally, but destiny has taken me in other directions. 

Now, I decided to revisit C, and here is, if you will, my notes about the it. The idea is not to provide a comprehensive material of the language, but instead to have some notes while I revise it. Hopefully, this material will be useful for someone else.

# Learning and coding

# Compiling and running the code

In order to compile the code execute:

```
gcc -o toBeExecuted.out toBeExecuted.c
```

where toBeExecuted.c is the source-file holding the C code and toBeExecuted.out is the file to be executed. To run it, simple execute:

```
./toBeExecuted.out
```

# Leaning by example

Each topic below is the execution of a certain file with things to learn for C programming.

## Hello World

The first file, [hello.c](./hello.c) is the simples "Hello World" possible, thus no explanation is needed.

To compile it, execute: `gcc -o hello.out hello.c`, and to run: `./hello`. Note that this follows the explanation in the session [Compiling and running the code](#compiling-and-running-the-code)

## SizeOf

The file [sizeof.c](./sizeof.c), when executed shows the size in byte of each C primitive, as well as important constants holding minimum and maximum values for each primitive.

From now on, no instructions on how to execute the files will be given, since the section [Compiling and running the code](#compiling-and-running-the-code) shows how it is done.
